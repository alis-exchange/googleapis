# googleapis
This repo contains a subset of frequently used protos from google. The original googleapis repo is huge and contains a lot of protos that are not used by most projects. 
This repo is meant to be a lightweight alternative to the original googleapis repo which can be found [here](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis).

## Roadmap
1. Setup repo such that these protos are "pulled" directly from the original googleapis repo (i.e. using git subtrees or sparse-checkout)
2. Setup a scheduler to update the repo on a weekly/monthly basis
