# googleapis
This repo contains a subset of frequently used protos from google

## Roadmap
1. Setup repo such that these protos are "pulled" directly from the original googleapis repo (i.e. using git subtrees or sparse-checkout)
2. Setup a scheduler to update the repo on a weekly/monthly basis
